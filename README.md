# Facial-Recognition-Login-System

Developed a GUI-based application for user authentication using facial recognition technology. The application utilizes tkinter for the user interface, OpenCV for real-time webcam feed, and a facial recognition subprocess for identifying registered users. Key features include user registration, login/logout functionalities, and activity logging. The system ensures secure access by validating user identities through captured images.
